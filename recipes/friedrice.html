    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cooked jasmine rice (cold, day old)</li>
        <li>1 green onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2.5 tablespoons light soy sauce (not dark soy sauce)</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat half of the oil in a wok and allow it to smoke.</li>
        <li>Pour in beaten eggs. Quickly stir-fry the eggs so they take shape.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs take shape but are still moist, quickly add the rice. If the rice is clumped together, break it apart in the wok.</li>
        <li>Sweep everything to the side of the pan, then add the remaining oil to the empty space and add the green onion. Mix the green onion into the rice and eggs.</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce and sesame oil along the edges of the wok, then toss until the grains are colored brown. Remove from heat and serve hot.</li>
