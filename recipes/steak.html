    <h1>How To Cook Steak On The Stovetop</h1>
    <img src="../panSearedSteak.jpg" alt="Steaks being cooked in a cast-iron skillet.">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    With just a handful of ingredients and a single pan, you can prepare a steak that rivals anything youâ€™d enjoy at a high-end steakhouse.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 New York strip or ribeye steaks</li>
        <li>1 heaping teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>A few sprigs fresh thyme leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat the steaks dry with paper towels, then season all over with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat a heavy pan (preferably cast-iron or stainless steel) over medium-high heat until very hot, then add oil and heat until it begins to shimmer and move fluidly in the pan.</li>
        <li>Carefully set the steaks in the pan, releasing them away from you so that the oil doesn't splatter in your direction.</li>
        <li>Leave the steaks alone to develop a golden crust. Flip the steaks when they release easily and the bottom is a deep-brown color, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook the steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes for medium rare. For medium, cook for 4 to 5 minutes. For well-done, cook for 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>During the last minute of cooking, add the butter and thyme sprigs to the pan with the steaks.</li>
        <li>If serving the steaks unsliced, transfer them to plates and serve hot. If you plan to slice the steaks, transfer them to a cutting board and cover with aluminum foil. Let steaks rest for 5 to 10 minutes, then slice thinly against the grain.</li>
    </ol>
